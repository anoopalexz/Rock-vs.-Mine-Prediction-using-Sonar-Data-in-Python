# Rock-vs.-Mine-Prediction-using-Sonar-Data-in-Python
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning to predict whether an object is a rock or a mine based on sonar data. It leverages a logistic regression model to achieve this task, offering a foundation for further exploration of sonar-based object classification.
