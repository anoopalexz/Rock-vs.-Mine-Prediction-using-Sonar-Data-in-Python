# Rock-vs.-Mine-Prediction-using-Sonar-Data-in-Python
## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning to predict whether an object is a rock or a mine based on sonar data. It leverages a logistic regression model to achieve this task, offering a foundation for further exploration of sonar-based object classification.
## DataSet
The dataset has been collected from the UCI Repository. It has come across 61 features that define and differentiate Rocks and Mines and comprises 209 samples. This data is used for training and testing purposes. The Last column in this dataset indicates that, whether it's a mine or a rock, which is useful in prediction. The dataset is included in this repository.
## Getting Started:
• Ensure the required libraries (numpy, pandas, sklearn) are installed.

• Run the code to train the model and evaluate its performance.

• Provide new sonar data as input to make predictions.

**This project explores the use of machine learning in classifying objects (rock or mine) based on sonar data. It leverages a Logistic Regression model for this task, demonstrating the following steps:**

• **Data Loading:** Reads sonar data from a CSV file.

• **Feature Engineering:** Separates features (sonar measurements) from the target variable (object class).

• **Data Splitting:** Divides the data into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model.

• **Model Training:** Trains a Logistic Regression model on the training data.

• **Model Evaluation:** Calculates accuracy scores on both training and testing data to assess the model's performance.

• **Prediction:** Provides functionality to predict the class of new sonar data points.

## Key Features
### Data preprocessing: 
Handles scaling and splitting of sonar data into training and testing sets.
### Model training: 
Employs logistic regression to learn patterns from the training data.
### Performance evaluation: 
Assesses the model's accuracy in predicting object classes.
### Prediction functionality: 
Enables using the trained model to make predictions on new sonar data.
## Model
The model used here is  **Logistic Regression**. Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. Logistic Regression uses a sigmoid or logit function which will squash the best fit straight line that will map any values including the exceeding values from 0 to 1 range. So it forms an “S” shaped curve. Sigmoid func. removes the effect of an outlier and makes the output between 0 to 1. As it is a binary classification model it is perfect to predict if an object is mine or rock based on the sonar data.

## Further Exploration:

• Experiment with different machine learning algorithms for comparison.

• Explore feature engineering techniques to improve model accuracy.

• Implement visualizations to analyze the relationship between sonar features and object classes.
